# DEVLOG - Simple SciFiRPG

*This document is a kind of small, personal devlog where I keep additional notes on development, difficulties I had and problems and solutions I encountered. It goes a little bit beyond the scope of the readme file so I broke it out into a seperate document. Please bare in mind that this is just a personal notebook and not a completed writeup, so it may contain a lot of unfinished and unpolished thoughts.*
*But maybe it can be useful for someone else looking for help while getting started with Phaser 3.*
