# SIMPLE SCI-FI RPG

A small, simple game Project using Phaser 3 to improve my JavaScript development Skills.

## What this project is about

It is more fun to code a game than another website. And with all the interactivity required it poses enough of a challenge while being gracefully expandable. This means I can add new parts of the game as and when I see fit.

The focus is to learn the language JavaScript itself as well as complementary web development skills that I can put to good use on other projects.

I may even create the art assets myself further down the line, but at the moment this is not planned.
Furthermore this is mainly a learning endeavor, so don't expect polished visuals or quest design.

But, I do hope that I will be able to create a fun, albeit short, little game in the end.

# SETTING

The setting will be a Science Fiction universe. The two main reasons for that are 1. Fantasy RPGs are in abundance and 2. If I get to create my own game art, I prefer Science Fiction Hard Surface style (for now).

# RESSOURCES

*During Development I used a countless number of resources to help me learn and create this small game project. It is not possible to list them all, but I will keep a list with links to mayor contributions to the project and my learning process* 

A three part tutorial series that I used to get the first setup going. It does not explain the whys very well, but it is structured enough to follow along: https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-create-a-turn-based-rpg-game-in-phaser-3-part-1/
